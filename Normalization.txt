*.* -> 

CANDIDATE KEY :-
-> SUBSET OF SUPERKEY HAVING NO REDUNDANT DATA WHICH CAN UNIQULY DEFINE A TUPPLE(ROW)

SUPERKEY :-
-> A COMBINATION OF ATTRIBUTES WHICH CAN UNQUIELY DEFINE A TUPPLE WITH THE HELP OF P&C.

ALTERNATE KEY :-
-> ALL CANDIDATEKEY EXCEPT PRIMARYKEY

FOREIGN KEY:-
CREATE A RELATION BTW 2 TABLES

COMPOSITE KEY :-
-> PRIMARY KEY FOUND OUT BY 2 ATTRIBUTE 

COMPOUND KEY :-
-> PRIMARY KEY FOUND OUT BY 2 CANDIDATE KEY

SURROGATE KEY :-
->> Eg :- 2 SCHOOL HAVING COLUMNS (COMMON) AFTER JOINING CREATES AN OWN COLOUMN ITSELF BY DB WHICH 
		 IS KNOWN AS SURROGATE KEY(INTEGER)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCIES :-
A -> B
-> WITH THE HELP OF ONE ATTRIBUTE (A) WE CAN FIND OUT THE VALUE OF ANOTHER ATTRIBUTE(B)
=> A -> DETERMINANT
=> B -> DEPENDENT

TYPES:-

1. TRIVAL
-> Here A/B is the SUBSET of AB 
-> CANDIDATE KEY
-> NO NEW ATTRIBUTE COMES AS A RESULT

-> AB -> A
-> AB -> B

2. NON-TRIVAL
-> Here C is NOT the SUBSET of AB
-> NEW ATTRIBUTE COMES AS A RESULT

-> AB -> ABC

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NORMALIZATION :-
-> TO REMOVE REDUNDENCIES

IF NORMALIZATION DOESNOT REMOVED ?
-> THREE PROBLEMS OR ANOMOLIES OCCURS DUE TO REPEATATION , NAMELY:=> 

1. INSERT:-
-> IF ANY DEPENDENT DTAA IS INSERTED THEN THE DATA INSERTED IS SHOWING NULL
-> THAT DEPENDENCY SHOULD BE PRESENT BEFORE
2. DELETE
-> IF ANY SINGLE DEPENDENCY IS THEIR AND WE DELETE THAT , THAT WILL LOOSE ALL ITS DATA
3. UPDATE
-> IF NO DEPENDENCIES ARE CHOOSE THEN WE CANNOT PLACE THAT IN DB

=> THIS WILL BE SOLVED WITH THE HELP OF NORMALIZATION

-> IN NORMALIZATION , WE DECOMPOSE THE TABLE INTO ITS SINGLE RESPONSIBLE PRINCIPLE (SRP)FORM 

# NORMALIZATION FORMS

1.	1NF
2.	2NF
3.	3NF
7.	BNF - BOYCE CODE  NF

NORMALIZATION :- DECOME TABLE INTO SUB-TABLE UNTIL SRP OBTAIN

-> EACH TABLE ORGANIZE THE MAIN TABLE IN SUCH A WAY THAT EVERY ATTRIBUTE DEPICTS THE MAIN TABLE ELEMENT 

FORMS

1NF -> EVERY RELATION  SET MUST HAVE AN ATOMIC VALUE
    => EACH ATTRIBUTE HAVING A SINGLE VALUE
    => DATA DUPLICASY OCCURED

2NF	-> IT SHOULD BE 1NF
	-> THEIR SHOULD NOT BE ANY PARTIAL DEPENDENCY(DETERMINE NON-PRIME BY PART OF PRIME KEY/ATTRIBUTE)
	-> AN ATTRIBUTE WHICH DOESNT DEFINE BY THE PART OF CANDIDATE KEY AS IF SOMETHING IS DELETED THEN ALL THE DATA IS LOSED.
	-> JUST BY DECOMPOSING TABLE.
	
3NF	-> IT SHOULD BE 2NF
	-> NO TRANSIVITY (FIND THE NON - PRIME ATTRIBUTE WITH NON-PRIME ATTRIBUTE) DEPENDENCY EXIST
	-> THUS AlSO 2 TABLES ARE TO BE CREATED.

BOYCE CODE NORMAL FORM  (BCNF) -> IT SHOULD BE 3NF
	-> EITHER NON-PRIMARY ATTRIBUTE OR PRIME ATTRIBUTE SHOULD NOT FIND OUT THE PRIME ATTRIBUTE
